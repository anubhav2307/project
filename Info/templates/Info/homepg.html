Other than just assembling the mutations, it also provides information about implications of these mutations on the structures and functions of proteins coded by these genes. The database can be used for searching, retrieving, analysing and downloading the data of mutations present in drug resistant MTB clinical isolates.</h3></ul>

                     <p><h3 style="font-family: 'Rasa Light">MycoTRAP-DB presents information about mutations which have been studied for diagnosis of drug resistance in TB however there are other mutations identified to be pathogenic by various sequence and structure based tools used in the present study. Future experimental studies can focus on these pathogenic mutations to decipher their possible roles and accountability for causing drug resistance and develop more efficient genotypic methods for diagnosis and detection of drug resistant TB.</h3></ul>
